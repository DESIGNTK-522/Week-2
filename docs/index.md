## Spring 2025

**Class Meetings:** Wednesday 1:25-4:15pm  
**Location:** 127 Wilkinson Building  
**Office Hours:** In-person (~1 hour after class)

**Phone/E-mail:** baykenney@gmail.com vivek.rao@duke.edu  
**Teaching Assistants:** TBC  
**TA Emails:** TBC  

## Pre-Requisites
Open to students enrolled in the M.Eng in Design & Technology Innovation or by application and consent of the instructor.

## Course Materials Required
Students will be provided with course materials. Students will be expected to have access to at least one Duke fabrication facility; at the time of this writing, these include the POD, the Foundry, and the Innovation Co-Lab.

## Software Required
* TinkerCAD
* VNC Server
* Adobe Creative Suite and/or another vector drawing program
* Python development environment with machine learning libraries (TensorFlow/PyTorch)
* Figma, Balsamiq
* Git and GitHub
* Raspberry Pi

## Course Description
In this course, students will advance their skills related to three technical toolkits core to design innovation practice:

* 2D- and 3D-modeling and digital fabrication
* Machine learning applications in design and prototyping
* User interface design and interactive experiences across multiple platforms (web, mobile, XR/AR, and physical computing)

The course revolves around extensive in-class experimentation, weekly skill-building assignments, a midterm project, and a final individual project intended to serve as a portfolio-ready piece.

## Learning Objectives
After completing this course, students will be able to:

* Design and fabricate 2D and 3D objects using a combination of Adobe Illustrator, TinkerCAD, lasercutters and additive manufacturing
* Apply machine learning techniques to enhance design processes and outcomes
* Implement basic ML models for computer vision and generative design
* Create user-centered interfaces across web, mobile, and XR platforms
* Design and conduct usability studies
* Develop interactive prototypes using various technologies
* Integrate ML capabilities into interactive applications
* Apply computational and data-driven methods for component design

## Expectations/Attendance Policy
Holidays/Breaks: TBC. Please refer to the Duke Registrar's Office for official campus holidays.

## Grading/Rubric
* Individual Skill-Building Assignments: 30%
* Midterm-Project: 30%
* Individual Final Project: 30%
* Attendance & Participation: 10%

## Collaboration Policy
Collaborative learning integrated into the course provides a dynamic learning environment in which to synthesize academic knowledge and experiences. It facilitates communication and critical thinking skills, strengthens leadership capacity, enhances project management skills, and promotes effective teamwork, along with learning to troubleshoot interpersonal/team issues.

Teams shall write and agree upon a team charter outlining team goals, individual goals, milestones and timelines, roles, processes and team norms.
